# Project Repository 📂

Welcome to this repository! This directory contains two main folders:  

📁 **JupyterFiles**  
📁 **PythonFiles**  

## 📌 JupyterFiles  
This folder contains all Jupyter Notebook runs in a live format, allowing you to see step-by-step executions. Each question is solved in a separate notebook, and for convenience, `all_in_one.ipynb` consolidates all the questions in one place.  

## 📌 PythonFiles  
This folder contains the equivalent Python scripts corresponding to the Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, it includes:  

- 🏋 **train.py** – A script to run and train the model.  
- 📄 **README.md** – A detailed guide on how to run the model and use the scripts effectively.  

For more details, check the individual README file inside the **PythonFiles** folder.

## 📖 Theory Overview  
This project involves solving multiple questions using Python and Jupyter notebooks. The theoretical concepts covered include:  
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Data preprocessing techniques  
- Optimization algorithms used in training  

For a **detailed explanation** of the theory behind the implementation, refer to the **README.md** inside the `PythonFiles` folder.
